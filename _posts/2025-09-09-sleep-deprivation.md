God I hate sleep deprivation… it’s actually horrible. I’m an insomniac so it’s nothing I’m not used to, but it was manageable for a while. Now it’s just this nonstop inability to sleep and it kills me. I’m so tired all of the time, but I’m never sleepy lmao. I would take melatonin but I really would like to not rely on medication… oh well we ball ig
