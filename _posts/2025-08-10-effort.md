I think it really infuriates me when people put like zero effort into anything that isn’t 100% required. I just feel that it’s just a huge waste of time to commit yourself to something and do as little of it as you can. I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong, but it just infuriates me when people do that and try to pass it on as a final product. It just ruins the vibe
