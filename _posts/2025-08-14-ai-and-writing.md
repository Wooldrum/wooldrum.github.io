Over the span of the last few years, I feel like AI and the amount of AI generated slop on the internet has really changed how I type and interact online. I genuinely feel that the rise of the “AI style” of writing mirrored the cadence of my formal writing, and over the years, it’s gradually pushed me to make my own style sound more “human,” which sucks, a lot. Like I can’t even use em dashes anymore without people instantly calling what I make AI. It’s a minor inconvenience,  I know, but it’s just interesting to me how it’s impacted my writing.
