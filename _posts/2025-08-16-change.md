Dude I am not built to handle change man

I met up with some old friends the other day and people just get so boring growing up — and yeah I get it, it’s a lot of responsibility and work, but I feel like everyone I meet nowadays are just husks of what they were. Sure, part of it is probably attributed to not speaking to them for a while, or that they’re overworked or tired or so on, but I just can’t get over the fact of just *how* soulless they were. It was like they were zombies dude. I think if I ever get to that point yall can just put me down because oh my god.
