I’m half writing this to bury the last post I made, but I find it really hard to forgive people. I feel like I tend to think that because I can’t directly tell their true emotions or true intentions, that I just always assume the worst. I feel like it’s a huge flaw in me, and I’ve been working to improve it, at least with like casual, day to day apologies, mainly with my girlfriend,  which might not help being I look at her and my brain starts yelling to me about how she is an angel from heaven and can do nothing wrong. But to not sidetrack I just find it very hard to accept apologies, and I really rarely do. Sometimes I lowkey feel like a pick-me-girl the way I’m like “that apology was not nearly good enough” (I would never actually say that I just think it in my head)

But yeah anyway I think I need to work on it, it just is hard especially because if I’m going to accept an apology I want it to be genuine and not just for the sake of doing it
