Look, I hate Elon and all, but lowkey I’m so bored of all the cars looking the same nowadays. I lowkey think the cybertruck looks kinda good *because* it stands out and isn’t like everything else

Also the futuristic look really is cool to me and while I think the smears all over the cybertruck mess it up a lot, I think it really is a step in the right direction.
