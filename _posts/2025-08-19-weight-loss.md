I think I want to start losing weight, I’m a big guy, and I always have been. For the most part I’ve been okay with that. I’ve never really been into caring about stuff like weight, and I treated it like fashion almost, and I was completely fine with being ugly. But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve started  to get the health risks of being fat too. My blood pressure it through the roof, mainly. I really really really would rather not go on blood pressure medication so I’m going to try to work out more and eat less. It’s hard, honestly. I know for most people it’s easy enough or they never had to worry about it, but I think I have the issue where I eat both when I’m bored and stressed and that’s a horrid combo. It also helps that I have a smoking hot girlfriend who probably would prefer if I lost weight (she’s not like telling me to, I just feel like I owe it to her) being I am the size of four of her. I’m not that huge, she’s just tiny. But back to weight loss, it does scare me because I’m just really not that good at routines and I’m afraid I’ll like stop halfway through. I’ve literally been using ChatGPT as like a fitness coach lol. To be fair, it’s given me some fire low cal breakfast options. Who knew there was so much you can make from eggs!
