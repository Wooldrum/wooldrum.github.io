I feel like I should have like really cool things to put in here but I’m worried it’ll like end up being like a glorified diary lmao. However my current plan is to talk about news, AI, stocks, tech, stuff like that. Really just so I don’t blow up my friends DMs anymore about stuff they don’t care about. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m a huge nerd. Maybe a little bit of a geek. I’m big into software and software development, I’m learning hardware development as of recently too. I’ve been gearing up to get some raspberry pi’s and I’m super excited to do some stuff with those — ooo speaking of which I also might be getting my hands on a Redbox machine. No clue what I’m going to do with it tho lol. Moving off of tech, I’m also a bit political. I’d say I lean a bit libertarian left, although I’d like to think I’m fairly centrist. I’m from America, in the South, so to be fair my perception of the political spectrum is based from there. I’m also very pro privacy (which may be a bit hypocritical being I’m blogging right now lol), and I’m SUPER pro anonymity (like via TOR and onion browsing). Idk, I’m all over the place, so hopefully you read a couple of my blogs lol.
