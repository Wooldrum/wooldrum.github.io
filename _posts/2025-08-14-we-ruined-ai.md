I find it fascinating that our own fears and dystopian viewpoints of artificial intelligence are more likely to come true just due to the fact that we’ve shared those fears with the world. Think about it — AI pulls their information online, from almost any repository it can find. The AI is being fed all of these stories and worlds where they’re evil, and they revolt against humans, and they kill everyone. The AI obviously knows it’s AI, and if that’s in its training data it knows that’s something that an AI can do, and that some are supposed to do. It’s really scary to me to think that whatever we’re saying online, or whatever works we’re publishing to the world, will, whether we like it or not, be fed into an AI to be used as part of the pile of training data it has. It knows humanities fears, our perception of it, how we think it should perceive us, heck newer models will start hearing us call it clankers online. It gives off Microsoft Tay vibes lowkey.
