I feel like, often times, I find myself in an emotional state where in the long term I have goals, I have plans, and I see myself happy, but in the short and medium term itâs impossible for me to function. Itâs 4:17am as Iâm writing this, and I still havenât been able to sleep. Iâve been too anxious thinking about everything Iâve messed up on. Itâs not like Iâm depressed â generally I think of the world as a good place, and Iâm grateful for where I am physically and mentally, but I just feel empty. I feel like no matter what I do, itâs only a tiny dent in a spiraling staircase of issues. I know this isnât the right way of thinking, but itâs just so much wrong that I donât know where to start. I feel like Iâm free-falling. The more that I donât work on these issues, the more there are, and the more that there are, the less I feel able to work on them. I feel lost and alone and without short term direction. 

The thing is, I do look forward to things. I do plan ahead. But that seems to only work for me if I do it long-term. For example, I want to move to Sweden in 4-6 years. That I do look forward to, and Iâm so excited. But in contrast, for stuff like college, Iâll have schoolwork due and if it becomes late Iâll just not do it. Itâs not because I canât, or because itâs difficult, but rather itâs because my anxiety just blocks it from my brain from thinking about it or whenever I open it I have a panic attack and fall to the floor. It sucks. Iâve tried everything to solve it, anchoring objects, 5-4-3-2-1 method, everything. I feel like anxiety tends to guide my life and that really isnât something I want. I should probably get medicated, but funnily enough, anxiety has held me back a lot from getting diagnosed.

I hope I eventually get something figured out, because I really feel like my life is unraveling and I donât know how to put it back together. I feel a mountain of stress and anxiety and burdens weighing over me and I just feel defeated.
