I feel like, often times, I find myself in an emotional state where in the long term I have goals, I have plans, and I see myself happy, but in the short and medium term it’s impossible for me to function. It’s 4:17am as I’m writing this, and I still haven’t been able to sleep. I’ve been too anxious thinking about everything I’ve messed up on. It’s not like I’m depressed—generally I think of the world as a good place, and I’m grateful for where I am physically and mentally, but I just feel empty. I feel like no matter what I do, it’s only a tiny dent in a spiraling staircase of issues. I know this isn’t the right way of thinking, but it’s just so much wrong that I don’t know where to start. I feel like I’m free-falling. The more that I don’t work on these issues, the more there are, and the more that there are, the less I feel able to work on them. I feel lost and alone and without short term direction.

The thing is, I do look forward to things. I do plan ahead. But that seems to only work for me if I do it long-term. For example, I want to move to Sweden in 4–6 years. That I do look forward to, and I’m so excited. But in contrast, for stuff like college, I’ll have schoolwork due and if it becomes late I’ll just not do it. It’s not because I can’t, or because it’s difficult, but rather it’s because my anxiety just blocks it from my brain from thinking about it or whenever I open it I have a panic attack and fall to the floor. It sucks. I’ve tried everything to solve it, anchoring objects, 5-4-3-2-1 method, everything. I feel like anxiety tends to guide my life and that really isn’t something I want. I should probably get medicated, but funnily enough, anxiety has held me back a lot from getting diagnosed.

I hope I eventually get something figured out, because I really feel like my life is unraveling and I don’t know how to put it back together. I feel a mountain of stress and anxiety and burdens weighing over me and I just feel defeated.
