Dude I don’t know why, but for the worst ever ear infection I’ve ever had. If I put my teeth together I’m 80% deaf, if I sleep on the bad ear, I’m deaf for like 30 minutes after I wake up. Worst part is that the doctor is closed on the weekends where I’m at. It is absolute torture dude. 1/10 would not recommend
